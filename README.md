A PowerArrayApp and a PowerBSTApp was created to handle the insertion and searching of the Array and Binary Search Tree respectively. 

A CSV utility is used to read in the data from the data file (.csv) provided. This is used to create an array of PowerUser objects (dateTime, power, voltage) in the PowerUserApp.

Instances of the OperationCount class store the bestCase, worstCase and average of the insertion and search methods of the Array and BST.

The compare() method in the PowerUserApp compares the various operations for a given subset of data and writes the results to a CSV file to enable easy comparisons using Excel or alternative graphing methods.
